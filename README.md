# Supermarket-Self-Service-Checkout
 This Python checkout system simplifies store transactions through two key classes: Product and CheckoutRegister. 
 Product handles item details, including name, price, and barcode. CheckoutRegister manages transactions, allowing
 customers to scan, pay, and receive receipts. A modular architecture boosts maintainability.
